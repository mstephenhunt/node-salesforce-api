### Node-Salesforce Integration
This is a sample for a Node-Salesforce integration. This allows you to hit both the `SOQL` and `REST` APIs exposed by Salesforce. For the `SOQL` queries, this allows the additional functionality of using SQL-like variables (like $1, $2, etc), protecting you from SQL injection.
